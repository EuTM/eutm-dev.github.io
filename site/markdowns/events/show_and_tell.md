Hey folks,

our next meetup is all about showing of our products, projects or discuss new ideas. This event is open for everyone and open end. Please bring your own drinks and food. In the evening we want to do a small bbq, so if you want to join us with that  make sure to bring your own meat and drinks.

This time we will also have some physical product demos present, so if you know additional makers, feel free to invite them! Depending on how many people want to present a demo or product, we will make presentation time available as well.

Hope to see you all on Sunday, September 27,  at 14h in Lemiers.


Cheers
Tom & Felix
