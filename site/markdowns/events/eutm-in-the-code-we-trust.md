Hi at all, 

this time we will have a meetup all about how to use Processing for prototyping and interactive art. 

Our speaker Tom Luyten (http://www.fiftylab.be/ ) will introduce us to the topic:

- A brief introduction to Processing
- How it can help to prototype code
- How it is applied in his work 
- And how it helps design installations for people with disabilities 


The workshop will take place at Crolla Lowis in Aachen.

We hope to see you all there.
