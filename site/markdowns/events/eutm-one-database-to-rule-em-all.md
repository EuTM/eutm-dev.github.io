Hi all,

this time Jonathan will introduce us to a database implemented in Javascript to be run in the browser: it is called PouchDB – it allows offline usage of a web application and at the time synchronizes with the server, so that many clients are able to replicate data instantly.

Jonathan will cover the following topics:

- explain the basic principles of PouchDB
- demonstrate setting up  a basic application
- highlight the benefits of live synchronization
- illustrate some of the pitfalls of this new approach to data storage

After that we'll have a lively discussion about the potential use cases.

This event will be hosted at INFORM GmbH, Pascalstraße 35, Aachen


Hope to see y'all there
