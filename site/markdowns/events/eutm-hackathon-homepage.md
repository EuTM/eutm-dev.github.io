Hey folks,

for ages we wanted to build a dedicated site that supports our community and is more welcoming to new people than meetup. For that we now want to jointly build the Euregio Tech Meetup homepage together.

In the first step we want to build a site that displays:

- all of our meetup events (i.e. meetup API)
- Made-In Company portfolio (i.e. migrate madeineuregio.com and make it look prettier :-)
- whatever you think should be on the site.

We believe that only the community can build this; so the more we are the merrier. We'll organize for some drinks and later will order pizza or other stuff together.

P.S.: Meetup does not really allow us to set separate times for the days; we will discuss those during Friday, it's also not necessary to be there everyday.

P.P.S.: Later this day, there will be an additional announcement, concerning Startup Weekend Maastricht, which Tom and I are part of, you can already check it via [the homepage](https://startupweekendmaastricht.com)
