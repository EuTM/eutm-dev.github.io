Hey folks, 

just after easter has passed, we want to present you our next workshop. We will focus on Test-driven development and testing. 
Lars Haßler, an expert on that field, will give us an introduction into the necessary steps for 

- Unit-testing and Integration testing 
- End2End tests for the web 
- CSS testing

After that we will have an open discussion about the best practices applied in all of our companies and some drinks ;-)

We will have our meetup in Maastricht at Mediablenders HQ at Capucijnenstraat 21.

Hope to see y'all there
