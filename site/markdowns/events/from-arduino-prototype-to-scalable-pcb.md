Hey folks,

this is a new format we are trying out. It is a workshop that spans a whole weekend, is about focussing into detail into a specific topic and trying to get to a result after these days.


You should participate if:

- have experience or a keen interest in Arduino-based projects
- know how to program (we will learn relevant C-stuff for the hardware interface)
- have fun building cool stuff

The agenda is as follows:

- Friday: Introduction into planning hardware from scratch (schematics, board drawings, etc); how to read/understand technical specification of vendors
- Saturday: build the PCB (We will visit the local FabLab in Aachen) and solder the components onto it
- Sunday: program it using C and be creative with it!

It's a rough agenda, should we be quicker with one part, we will directly go to the next!

As it is a bit harder to procure parts without knowing what to build, we would focus on implementing a 3d sensor and some basic microprocessor to help process the signals.

We will collect a small amount for buying the materials (through meetup). We added a small buffer for beer and pizza.

__Attention: Please bring your laptop with you!__

Hope to see you all there.

(PS.: in case you wondered ;-) PCB=> printed circuit board)
