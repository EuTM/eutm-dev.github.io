This time we want to gather and enjoy the wonderful weather.

This will give us time to talk about current challenges in our projects and see whether the community can find a solution. So this will be open topic!

We'll organize some of the best meat from a euregional butcher and some drinks. For that a 10 Euro contribution would be nice. Please briefly indicate whether you are a vegetarian.

Looking forward to seeing y'all.
